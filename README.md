# Bikesharing

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to aid in the decision making process of key stakeholders for a bike sharing company in Des Moines, Iowa. We used Tableau to create comparison visualizations in NYC of August's peak times, average trip duration, top locations, gender usage and overall number of rides.

Among the discoveries while analyzing the data, the notable are seen below: 

The highest number of bike rentals last within a 4 to 6 hour range.

In gender comparisons, men tend to ride significantly longer, with a peak at 5 hours in trip duration.

The busiest rental times (as shown here by the darkest color gradient) are Thursday's from 5pm to 7pm.

While their peak rental time (7am to 11am, 5pm to 7pm) and day (Thursday) are similar, men rent more frequently than women as illustrated below.

This last image highlights the difference in subscriber versus customer usage and reiterates the heavy amount of male bike rentals during peak hours later in the week.

## Summary

Reviewing these visuals paints a picture of high usage and high demand for shared bikes in a place like NYC. If Des Moines is anything like NYC I would say it's a good investment. Unfortunately, I have never been to Des Moines and don't have the data to compare. That being said, if the weather permits, and there are more men than women in population, it's probably a good idea.
